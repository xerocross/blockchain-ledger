# blockchain ledger

This widget is a toy for playing with a Merkle chain, which is the technology that blockchains are based on.  Each record in the chain is hashed and each record is stored with the hash of the previous record.  I rolled by own version of this in JavaScript except for the hashing.  For hashing I used a function from the SJCL library.
